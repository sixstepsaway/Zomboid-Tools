## Zomboid Tools
### Item List Tool
I've been modding my Project Zomboid recently and I wanted to do some custom loot and maybe some recipes, but I needed to know what items were in my modded game. Rimworld has a [lovely mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2811310482) that lets you output a table of all the modded defs, but I couldn't find anything like that for Zomboid, so I made my own.

It's simple to use. Boot it up, put your Workshop mods folder into input and an output folder into output and click generate. It'll produce an xml and a json.

If there's interest, I'll add a way of doing this with local mods as well (different folder trees, basically), but I don't see a need rn since I made this for me.
